        MyMusic.com was created with the intention to give users a chance to
        freely discover new music. There exist many music websites in today's
        world. These platforms provide users with a good music experience in which
        they can obtain playlists, discover new music, and more. But not everyone
        is able to pay for the subscription, and then, the experience becomes
        limited. That is why we want to optimize and enhance the experience of
        discovering new music for free for people looking to branch out. Current
        streaming platforms restrict you to genres and pre-made discovery
        playlists. Our website will use a song or artist the user enjoys to
        produce new and interesting playlists, with different results every time.
        This allows for an individualized unique experience per user, unlike the
        current platforms that make general ones and disperse them to many users.
